* The doxy file is the default one, except for the
  follwing:

CITE_BIB_FILES         = math_overview
LATEX_AUX_FILES        = math_overview

* By running the modified doxygen from withing this directory,
the \extref and \cite annotations in polar.h will be translated
using the math_overview.aux 'dictionary'.

IN THE CODE:

        /** \note This uses the Euler relation, see equation
         *        \texref eqn:euler in section \texref sec:euler
         *        in \cite MathOverview.
         */

IN THE HTML OUTPUT:

    get_cartesian():

    This uses the Euler relation, see equation 3 in section 2 in [1].


(Note that other output targets have not yet been updated.)
