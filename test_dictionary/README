INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW:

* Suppose that you are developing a code and external documents
  simultaneously, and that in code comments you wish to refer
  to content from the documents that will continuously change
  (equation, section and chapter numbers, ...), just like the
  code itself.

* I solved this by introducing a new Doxygen command \dictval,
  which requires a key as argument. Doxygen will replace occurrences
  of '\dictval <key>' with the value that is found for that key in
  external dictionary files, specified with the DICTIONARY_FILES
  configuration option. The first word of every non-empty line of such
  file is used as key, the remainder of that line as value.

* The dictionary files must be updated by the user (not Doxygen)
  whenever the external documents have changed. That makes this
  quite flexible and the number of changes that are required in the
  Doxygen code are very small.
  I myself used this for my C++ project with LaTeX documentation.
  I will work out an example in more detail.


EXAMPLE: Referring to LaTeX equation and section numbers from C++ comments.

 * Non-Doxygen parts:

In this example, the documentation is in a file math_overview.tex,
which is accompanied by a file math_overview.bib. The LaTeX
documentation is built by running pdflatex and bibtex, as in

  pdflatex math_overview && bibtex math_overview && pdflatex math_overview && pdflatex math_overview

This will create math_overview.pdf, but also math_overview.aux. The
latter is used to resolve references and contains (also) lines of
the form

  \newlabel{key}{{section-number}{page-number}...}

In order to translate this into a dictionary file I wrote a small script
parse_aux.sh (essentially a sed-oneliner), that can be used as follows:

  source parse_aux.sh math_overview.aux > math_overview.dict

For our present example, file math_overview.dict will look like:

  eqn:foo 1
  eqn:bar 2
  sec:euler 2
  eqn:euler 3

This file math_overview.dict is the only file that is seen by Doxygen.

 * Doxygen parts:

Now we run docygen, using the configuration file polar.doxy. That has
two lines

  CITE_BIB_FILES         = math_overview
  DICTIONARY_FILES       = math_overview.dict

In the code I have a comment that looks like:

  /** \note This uses the Euler relation, see equation
   *        \dictval eqn:euler in section \dictval sec:euler
   *        in \cite MathOverview.
   */

As can be seen in math_overview.dict, "\dictval eqn:euler" will be
replaced by "3" in the Doxygen output, "\dictval sec:euler" by "2".
The cite command does what it always does, and the user-visible
documentation will be something like:

  Note: This uses the Euler relation, see equation 3 in section 2 in [1].

Compiling the LaTeX document and updating the dict file is handled by
the build machinery, which ensures that everything is always uptodate.

Of course, this \dictval command can be used for other purposes as well,
but what I sketched above is what I needed myself.


TO TEST THE EXMAPLE ABOVE:

  1. build and configure this version of doxygen
  2. cd test_dictionary
  2. pdflatex math_overview && bibtex math_overview && pdflatex math_overview && pdflatex math_overview
  3. /path/to/doxygen/build_dir/doxygen polar.doxy
  4. firefox html/classPolarComplex.html and see the Note on that page
